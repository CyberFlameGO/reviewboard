================================
Review Board 4.0.2 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: TBD


New Features
============

* Added support for custom URL protocols in Markdown-rendered HTML.

  The recent changes to sanitize Markdown rendering removed the ability to
  use any arbitrary protocol in a URL (such as ones that would open links in
  an installed app).

  Administrators can now define protocols that are considered safe in
  :file:`settings_local.py`. For example:

  .. code-block:: python

      ALLOWED_MARKDOWN_URL_PROTOCOLS = ['gopher', 'ftp', 'eclipse']


Performance Improvements
========================

* Sped up some database queries used when performing access control checks
  for review requests.


Bug Fixes
=========

Authentication
--------------

* Session and CSRF cookies are now properly set as "Secure" when Review Board
  is configured for HTTPS.

  This avoids warnings and future behavioral changes in browsers.


GitLab
------

* Fixed a crash when configuring GitLab repositories. (:bug:`4928`)


Markdown
--------

* Fixed a crash that could occur with some invalid characters in e-mail
  addresses.


Subversion
----------

* Files represented in diffs with a ``(nonexistent)`` revision are now treated
  as deleted.
